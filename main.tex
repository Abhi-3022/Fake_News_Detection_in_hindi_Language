% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Internet users have been rapidly increasing in recent years, especially in India. That is why nearly everything operates in an online mode. Sharing information has also become simple and easy due to the internet and social media. Almost everyone now shares news in the community without even considering the source of information. As a result, there is the issue
of disseminating false, misleading, or fabricated data. Detecting
fake news is a challenging task because it is presented in such
a form that it looks like authentic information. This problem
becomes more challenging when it comes to local languages.
This paper discusses several deep learning models that utilize
LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN+LSTM, and CNN+BiLSTM. On the
Hostility detection dataset in Hindi, these models use Word2Vec,
IndicNLP fastText, and Facebook’s fastText embeddings for
fake news detection. The proposed CNN+BiLSTM model with
Facebook’s fastText embedding achieved an F1-score of 75\%,
outperforming the baseline model. Additionally, the BiLSTM
using Facebook’s fastText outperforms CNN+BiLSTM using
Facebook’s fastText on the F1-score.

% Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}

In recent years, the field of natural language processing has witnessed remarkable advancements, particularly in the development of conversational AI systems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that represents a significant leap forward in chatbot technology. This innovative approach combines the sophisticated language generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with precise information retrieval systems, creating a more reliable and accurate conversational agent.

The evolution of chatbot systems has been marked by several key developments. Early rule-based systems gave way to neural network-based approaches, but these often struggled with maintaining factual accuracy and relevance. The introduction of transformer-based architectures brought significant improvements in natural language understanding and generation. However, these systems still faced challenges with hallucination and factual consistency. RAG architecture addresses these limitations by implementing a hybrid approach that grounds responses in a verified knowledge base while maintaining the natural conversational abilities of large language models.

The fundamental principle behind RAG is the combination of two critical components: a retriever that identifies relevant information from a knowledge base, and a generator that produces contextually appropriate responses. This architecture ensures that the system can provide accurate, verifiable information while maintaining engaging and natural conversation flow. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to bridge the gap between static knowledge bases and dynamic language understanding, making it particularly valuable for applications requiring both accuracy and conversational fluency

\section{Motivation}

The development of this DUCS ChatBot project emerged from a critical observation of current limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like responses, they often struggle with hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and the inability to cite reliable sources. This becomes particularly problematic when dealing with domain-specific knowledge or when accurate, verifiable information is crucial. Traditional LLMs, despite their sophisticated training, can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect responses, which can be misleading and potentially harmful in real-world applications.

The choice of implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture was driven by its elegant solution to these limitations. RAG provides a way to ground the model's responses in factual, retrievable information while maintaining the natural conversational abilities of LLMs. By integrating a vector database for efficient information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models, RAG offers a more reliable and transparent approach to building conversational AI systems.

The decision to implement this project using the Jupyter Notebook environment was deliberate, as it provides an ideal platform for iterative development and experimentation with different components of the RAG system. The interactive nature of notebooks allows for real-time visualization of embedding spaces, immediate testing of retrieval mechanisms, and efficient debugging of the generation pipeline. This approach also makes the development process more transparent and accessible to other developers who might want to understand or build upon this work.

The project's technical stack was carefully chosen to optimize both development efficiency and system performance. Vector databases were selected for their ability to handle high-dimensional embedding spaces efficiently, while maintaining fast query capabilities essential for real-time conversations. The choice of embedding models and text chunking strategies was influenced by the need to balance accuracy with computational efficiency, ensuring the system remains responsive while maintaining high-quality information retrieval.

One of the key motivating factors was the need for a system that could be easily updated with new information without requiring complete model retraining. Traditional approaches often struggle with knowledge cutoff dates or require expensive fine-tuning procedures to incorporate new information. The RAG architecture elegantly solves this by separating the knowledge base from the language model, allowing for dynamic updates to the information while maintaining consistent generation capabilities.

Furthermore, the project was motivated by the need for transparency in AI systems. Users should not only receive answers but also understand where these answers come from. By implementing source attribution and maintaining clear connections to the underlying knowledge base, this system aims to build trust with users while providing accurate and helpful responses. This approach aligns with the growing demand for explainable AI systems in various domains, from customer service to technical documentation assistance.

The development timeline outlined in the project plan reflects a pragmatic approach to building a system that balances sophistication with practicality. Rather than attempting to create an all-encompassing solution, the focus is on developing a robust foundation that demonstrates the potential of RAG architecture while remaining maintainable and extensible for future improvements.

\section{Problem Statement}

In the rapidly evolving landscape of conversational AI, the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges that demand innovative solutions. While LLMs have revolutionized natural language processing, their inherent limitations in handling factual information and maintaining reliable knowledge bases have become increasingly apparent. The core problem lies in creating a chatbot system that can maintain the natural conversational abilities of LLMs while ensuring factual accuracy and providing verifiable information sources.

Traditional chatbot implementations face several critical challenges that this project aims to address. The primary issue is the trade-off between conversational fluency and factual accuracy. Current LLM-based systems excel at generating human-like responses but often produce plausible-sounding yet incorrect information. This "hallucination" problem becomes particularly acute when dealing with specialized knowledge domains or when precise, factual responses are essential. The absence of a reliable mechanism to ground these responses in verifiable sources creates a significant trust deficit in AI-powered conversational systems.

Another fundamental challenge is the static nature of knowledge in traditional LLM implementations. Once trained, these models' knowledge becomes frozen in time, making it difficult to update or incorporate new information without expensive and time-consuming retraining processes. This limitation severely restricts their utility in dynamic environments where information constantly evolves. The need for a system that can efficiently update its knowledge base while maintaining consistent performance is crucial for practical applications.

The scalability of knowledge integration presents another significant challenge. As the volume of domain-specific information grows, traditional approaches struggle to effectively manage and retrieve relevant information in real-time. The problem extends beyond mere storage to include efficient indexing, retrieval, and contextual understanding of the stored information. Current systems often lack the sophisticated architecture needed to handle large-scale knowledge bases while maintaining quick response times and accuracy.

Furthermore, the challenge of context management in conversational systems remains a significant hurdle. Existing solutions frequently struggle to maintain coherent, context-aware conversations over extended interactions. This limitation is compounded by the difficulty of balancing the depth of knowledge retrieval with the need for natural, flowing conversation. The system must not only provide accurate information but also maintain the context of the conversation while delivering responses in a conversational manner.

The implementation of effective source attribution and verification mechanisms poses another substantial challenge. Current systems often lack transparency in their response generation process, making it difficult for users to verify the authenticity and reliability of the information provided. This lack of transparency undermines user trust and limits the utility of these systems in professional or educational contexts where source verification is crucial.

These challenges collectively point to the need for a more sophisticated approach to chatbot development, one that can effectively combine the strengths of large language models with reliable information retrieval systems. The RAG ChatBot project aims to address these fundamental problems by implementing a hybrid architecture that can maintain conversational fluency while ensuring factual accuracy, scalability, and transparency in its operations.

Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, including open-domain QA and abstractive generation, with RAG models generating more factual and diverse language than traditional seq2seq models​


\section{RAG-based Chatbot using LLMs}

The paper explores the evolution and implementation of chatbots, emphasizing their transformative role across various industries through advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Chatbots have emerged as a cornerstone of modern automation, offering enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and 24/7 availability while reducing reliance on human resources. Their integration has revolutionized fields such as education, healthcare, and business by enabling seamless interaction and task automation.

Research in the domain highlights significant progress in tailoring chatbots for specific applications. For instance, a college inquiry chatbot addresses the challenges of navigating institutional websites, enabling users to obtain accurate information about academics, admissions, and other activities. Similarly, healthcare chatbots have been developed to provide disease diagnoses and treatment recommendations, offering detailed insights into symptoms and risk factors while alleviating the burden on medical professionals during the pandemic.

A central theme in the literature is the use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combined with Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG bridges generative models with external knowledge sources, significantly enhancing the contextuality and relevance of responses. Studies have demonstrated the superior performance of in-house retrieval embedding models compared to general-purpose alternatives, particularly in retrieval accuracy and handling out-of-domain queries. Reinforcement learning has also been employed to optimize token usage, reducing computational costs without compromising response quality.

The integration of LLMs in corporate environments presents unique challenges due to limitations on internal data usage. However, researchers have demonstrated innovative approaches to implementing generative AI within frameworks like LangChain and RAG. These methods utilize fine-tuning and semantic retrieval techniques to provide accurate, contextually rich responses, facilitating effective communication in business settings.

Overall, the literature highlights the versatility of chatbots and the potential for continued innovation. With advancements in retrieval mechanisms, optimization strategies, and domain-specific adaptations, chatbots are poised to address increasingly complex queries while minimizing limitations like hallucination and improving factual accuracy. These developments pave the way for more sophisticated, efficient, and scalable conversational systems, enabling their application across diverse sectors.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Architectural Overview}
The DUCS ChatBot system implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture that begins with web scraping to build the knowledge base, converts the scraped data into structured YAML format, and then uses this structured data for the RAG implementation.

\subsection{High-Level Architecture}
The system architecture consists of four primary layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Web Scraping and Data Collection Layer
    \item Data Structuring Layer
    \item Retrieval Layer
    \item Generation Layer
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\section{Database Integration}
The data integration system forms the backbone of our DUCS ChatBot, implementing a streamlined ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline specifically designed for academic information retrieval. The process begins with web scraping from the Department of Computer Science website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4, extracting relevant content while maintaining structural integrity. This raw data undergoes thorough cleaning and normalization processes, removing noise and standardizing formats for optimal processing. The cleaned text is then transformed into vector embeddings using the sentence-transformers model, creating a sophisticated searchable knowledge base. These embeddings are indexed in a vector store, enabling efficient similarity searches for user queries. The system maintains data quality through continuous validation checks and regular updates, ensuring the chatbot provides accurate and relevant responses while adapting to new information as it becomes available.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagram - 10.png}
    \caption{Database integration}
    \label{fig:Data Integration}
\end{figure}

\section{AI-Based Insights}
The AI-based insights component represents the intelligent core of our DUCS ChatBot, combining advanced natural language processing with semantic search capabilities to deliver contextually relevant responses. When a user query is received, it's transformed into a dense vector representation using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, enabling semantic similarity matching against our knowledge base. The system leverages FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to efficiently retrieve the most relevant context from the vector store, which is then processed by the language model to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This hybrid approach ensures that responses are not only accurate but also maintain semantic relevance to the academic domain of computer science. The system continuously learns from interactions, refining its context selection and response generation capabilities through built-in similarity thresholds and relevance scoring, ultimately providing users with insights that are both informative and contextually aligned with their queries about the Department of Computer Science at the University of Delhi.
